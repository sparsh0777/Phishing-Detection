Overview
This project focuses on detecting phishing websites using machine learning techniques. Phishing websites deceive users into providing sensitive information by imitating legitimate websites. By leveraging a dataset of features extracted from websites, this project aims to build an effective detection system.

Features
Feature Engineering: Extract and process features related to URL structure, website behavior, and hosting information.
Machine Learning Models: Implementation and comparison of classification algorithms for phishing detection.
Evaluation Metrics: Assess model performance using precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-score.
Visualization: Insights into feature importance and detection results.
